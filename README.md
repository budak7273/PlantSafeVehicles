# Plant Safe Vehicles

Change or remove the range in which vehicles destroy plants when you drive over them!

This mod was inspired by a suggestion from `Cyclonit#7350`.

## Usage

By default, the mod will set the plant destruction radius of all vehicles to 0 meters, meaning that they will no longer destroy plants when you drive over them. You can also increase this range to an arbitrary number, but be careful going too big.

You can modify this in the mod config settings.

The base-game's plant destruction radius differs depending on the vehicle. For example, the explorer's range is 3750 centimeters.
