# Plant Safe Vehicles

Change or remove the range in which vehicles destroy plants when you drive over them!

**Multiplayer Compatible!**

This mod was inspired by a suggestion from `Cyclonit#7350`.

Wondering where the mod icon came from? Ask Feyko.

## Usage

By default, the mod will set the plant destruction radius of all vehicles to 0 meters,
meaning that they will no longer destroy plants when you drive over them.
You can also increase this range to an arbitrary number, but be careful going too big.

You can modify this in the mod config settings.

The base-game's plant destruction radius differs depending on the vehicle.
For example, the explorer's range is 3750 centimeters.

## Known Bugs

Unfortunately, even with the plant destruction radius set to 0,
**vehicles will still destroy Berry and Nut Bushes** when you drive directly over them.
I can't seem to find a cause, or fix, for this behavior.
