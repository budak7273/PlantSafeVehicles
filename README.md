# Plant Safe Vehicles

Remove (or increase) the range in which vehicles destroy plants when you drive over them!

**Multiplayer Compatible!**

This mod was inspired by a suggestion from `Cyclonit#7350`.

Consider using the mod [Gardener Toolkit](https://ficsit.app/mod/GardenerTools) to selectively restore foliage that may have been removed before you found this mod.

Wondering where the mod icon came from? Ask Feyko.

## Usage

By default, the mod will set the scale of the plant destruction colliders of all vehicles to 0,
meaning that they **will no longer destroy plants** (and nuts and berries) when you drive over them.
You can modify this in the mod config settings.

The value you control is a multiplier to the size of the base game's collider for the vehicle,
so the resulting plant destruction radius differs depending on the vehicle.
For example, the explorer's base-game range is 1.0 scale on a box of 300.0 x 200.0 x 125.0 centimeters.
